# Human cytotoxicity endpoints

The authors tested the dataset of 39312 compounds from the antibiotics-ai model (eos18ie) against several cytotoxicity endpoints; human liver carcinoma cells (HepG2), human primary skeletal muscle cells (HSkMCs) and human lung fibroblast cells (IMR-90). Cellular viability was measured after 20133 days of treatment with each compound at 10 Î¼M and activities were binarized using a 90% cell viability cut-off. 341 (8.5%), 490 (3.8%) and 447 (8.8%) compounds classified as cytotoxic for HepG2 cells, HSk-MCs and IMR-90 cells
